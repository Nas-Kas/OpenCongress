# AI Bill Summarizer Enhancement Spec

## Overview
Enhance the existing AI bill summarizer to provide more interactive and comprehensive analysis capabilities for users exploring legislative content.

## Current State
- BillPlainSummarizer generates structured markdown summaries
- BillTextScraper extracts comprehensive bill data
- FastAPI endpoint `/generate-summary` provides AI analysis
- Frontend displays bills without votes for betting opportunities

## Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Summary Display
- **Interactive Summary Cards**: Replace plain text with expandable cards showing:
  - Executive summary with key impacts
  - Financial breakdown with visual indicators
  - Timeline of important deadlines
  - Affected stakeholders with icons
- **Complexity Scoring**: Add readability and complexity metrics
- **Comparison Mode**: Allow side-by-side bill comparisons

### 2. Real-time Analysis Features
- **Live Updates**: Stream summary generation progress to frontend
- **Incremental Loading**: Show sections as they're analyzed
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of partial analysis failures
- **Cache Management**: Smart caching with invalidation strategies

### 3. Advanced AI Capabilities
- **Multi-model Support**: Add Claude/Gemini as fallback options
- **Specialized Prompts**: Domain-specific analysis for different bill types
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detect controversial or bipartisan language
- **Impact Prediction**: ML model for predicting bill success probability

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- **Summary Bookmarking**: Save and organize favorite summaries
- **Export Options**: PDF, Word, and JSON export formats
- **Sharing Features**: Generate shareable summary links
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for mobile analysis
