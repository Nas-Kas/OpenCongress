## Monitoring Implementation

### 1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
```python
import time
import logging
from functools import wraps

def monitor_performance(operation_name):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            try:
                result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
                duration = time.time() - start_time
                
                # Log performance metrics
                logger.info(f"{operation_name} completed in {duration:.2f}s")
                
                # Send metrics to monitoring system
                metrics.timing(f"{operation_name}.duration", duration)
                metrics.increment(f"{operation_name}.success")
                
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                duration = time.time() - start_time
                logger.error(f"{operation_name} failed after {duration:.2f}s: {e}")
                metrics.increment(f"{operation_name}.error")
                raise
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

### 2. Database Query Monitoring
```python
class DatabaseMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.slow_query_threshold = 1.0  # seconds
        
    async def log_query(self, query, params, duration):
        if duration > self.slow_query_threshold:
            logger.warning(f"Slow query detected: {duration:.2f}s")
            logger.warning(f"Query: {query}")
            logger.warning(f"Params: {params}")
            
            # Alert if query is extremely slow
            if duration > 5.0:
                await send_alert(
                    "Critical slow query detected",
                    f"Query took {duration:.2f}s to execute"
                )
```
